Description: Functions to generate graphs that maximise the NODF metric for a given
    number of rows, columns and links. As nestedness in ecological networks
    depends on the size of the networks we require normalisation to make them
    comparable. We offer three highly optimised algorithms to find the
    optimising graphs so that users can choose an appropriate trade off between
    computation time and NODF value for the task at hand.
