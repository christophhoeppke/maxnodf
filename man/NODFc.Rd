\title{Calculate NODF_c for a bipartite network}
\usage{
NODFc(web, quality = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{A numeric matrix describing a bipartite network (a bipartite incidence matrix where elements are positive numbers if nodes interact, and 0 otherwise).}

\item{quality}{An optional quality parameter to control the tradeoff between computation time and result quality. Can be 0, 1 or 2.}
}
\value{
Returns the value of NODF_c as a single number.
}
\description{
Calculates the NODF_c metric proposed by Song et al (2017) for a bipartite incidence matrix
}
\details{
For a given network, \code{NODFc} calculates the NODF_c metric proposed by Song et al (2017), defined as \eqn{(NODF/max(NODF))/(C * log(S))} where C is the network connectance, S is the geometric mean of the number of plants and pollinators in the network,
NODF is the raw NODF of the network and max(NODF) is the maximum nestedness that can be achieved in a network with the same number of rows, columns and links as \code{web}, subject to the constraint that all rows and columns must have at least one link (i.e. marginal totals must always be >= 1). 
\code{NODFc} has three algorithms for finding the maximum nestedness of a bipartite network. These can be set using the \code{quality} argument. Lower quality settings are faster, but find worse optima. Higher quality settings
are slower, but find better optima.
\itemize{
\item{\code{quality} = 0, uses a greedy algorithm.}
\item{\code{quality} = 1, uses a greedy algorithm plus hillclimbing.}
\item{\code{quality} = 2, uses a simulated annealing algorithm, with the greedy algorithm output as the start point. Best results, but requires the most computation time.}
