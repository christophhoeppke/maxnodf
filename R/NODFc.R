#' Calculate NODF_c for a bipartite network
#'
#' Calculates the NODF_c metric proposed by Song et al (2017) for a bipartite incidence matrix
#' @param web A numeric matrix describing a bipartite network (a bipartite incidence matrix where elements are positive numbers if nodes interact, and 0 otherwise).
#' @param quality An optional quality parameter to control the tradeoff between computation time and result quality. Can be 0, 1 or 2.
#' @details For a given network, \code{NODFc} calculates the NODF_c metric proposed by Song et al (2017), defined as \eqn{(NODF/max(NODF))/(C * log(S))} where C is the network connectance, S is the geometric mean of the number of plants and pollinators in the network,
#' NODF is the raw NODF of the network and max(NODF) is the maximum nestedness that can be achieved in a network with the same number of rows, columns and links as \code{web}, subject to the constraint that all rows and columns must have at least one link (i.e. marginal totals must always be >= 1). 
#' \code{NODFc} has three algorithms for finding the maximum nestedness of a bipartite network. These can be set using the \code{quality} argument. Lower quality settings are faster, but find worse optima. Higher quality settings
#' are slower, but find better optima.
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\code{quality} = 0, uses a greedy algorithm.}
#' \item{\code{quality} = 1, uses a greedy algorithm plus hillclimbing.}
#' \item{\code{quality} = 2, uses a simulated annealing algorithm, with the greedy algorithm output as the start point. Best results, but requires the most computation time.}
#' }
#' @return Returns the value of NODF_c as a single number.
